settings:
  # If a track is missing the replay gain tag, it could get annoyingly loud
  default_gain: -6.02

  # CamillaDSP can take positive values for digital gain. As this potentially
  # can be harmful we set max positive gain in dB replay gain can operate 
  # If LessLoss is active it does not support digital gain and return 0dB attunation

  # When the player connect with LMS the server will try to set volume to 100%. We try
  # to supress this by ignoring volume changes the first few seconds after restart of
  # Squeezelite. Still it sometimes can fail. Setting 'ignore_max_volume' to true will
  # ensure 100% are never passed to CamillaDSP. Meaning we can max adjust to 99%.
  # Recommended set to true if CamillaDSP is the main volume control in the system
  ignore_max_volume: false
  
  # How frequently we check if connection to LMS CLI port is alive. Value given in seconds.
  keepalive_interval: 10
  
  # Since we receive asynchronous events from LMS, there are occasions when we
  # may encounter the start of a track before we can intervene and adjust the 
  # sample rate. This sounds like stutter and one might prefer a pause before
  # track start over with correct sample rate. The switching itself is trimmed
  # down to approx 650-840ms on RPi4. Where more than half of the time 
  # and most varying time is devoted to stopping the Squeezelite service.
  stutter_delay: 0
  
  # When Squeezelite restart it need a moment to reconnect before we send commands
  # 40ms seem to function well with RPi5 server and RPi4 Squeezelite player.

  # machines add longer delay - valid numbers are 0.01 - 1, default is 0.04

  # When track is missing sample rate information fall back to this sample rate
  # Compressed audio format will normally not expose such information and usually expect 44.1kHz
